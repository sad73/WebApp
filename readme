Hello SNA,

I have built this website with a strong focus on security and user experience. The entire project is developed using PHP with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making the code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

One of my main goals was to reduce common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). To help prevent SQL injection, I used prepared statements (prepare() and bind_param()) for all database interactions, ensuring user inputs are safely handled. For XSS prevention, I used the htmlspecialchars() function to encode special characters in user inputs before displaying them in the browser.

In addition, I implemented custom session management using a separate database table. For every session, I store the user's ID (uid), a unique token, user agent, remote IP address, creation time, and an active status flag. This gives full control over user sessions, making it easy to detect anomalies or unauthorized access.

To add another layer of protection, even if someone tries to steal a session cookie, they won’t be able to use it from another device or browser. This is because the session is validated using both the user agent and IP address. If either one doesn't match the original session, access is denied immediately.

Most of the security practices I’ve applied here are based on what I learned from the LAHTP (Learn the hacking thorugh the programming) course. It gave me hands-on knowledge about how web vulnerabilities work and how to defend against them in real-world scenarios using secure PHP coding techniques.

and i have created a json file out of the htdocs folder for extra security layer.

While no application is ever completely secure, I’ve tried my best to follow strong coding practices and reduce potential attack surfaces. This project represents my growth as a developer and my dedication to building secure, user-friendly and enjoyable web applications.
